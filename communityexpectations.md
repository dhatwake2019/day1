# Community Guidelines

We will be develop guidelines as a group for our workshop.  Several conditions:
- Make sure the guideline is in the affirmative. 
- Use concrete action language.  (Ex. Don't interrupt -> Allow others to finish their thoughts.)   


1. Write down 2-3 guidelines.  
2. In pairs, share your guidelines and select 2 to share with the group. 
3. Share with the group your guidlines. 
4. Are there other guidelines that we should add?

## Why Text Analysis?

On a piece of paper, write down:
  - Your definition of text analysis.
  - 2-3 reasons that you are interested in text analysis. For example, do you have a particular project in mind?  Excited about a particular method? 
  - If applicable, a project or two (i.e digital project, article, etc) that peaked your interest in text analysis. 

In groups of 3, share your answers. In ~10 minutes, each break out group will report back and address the following questions:
  - Share the definitions and how they are similar and different.
  - Select 2-3 reasons to share that reflects the groups interests. 
  - Share 1-2 projects from the group and provide a brief explaination of the project and its relationship to text analysis.
